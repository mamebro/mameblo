## General
* Create a proper build script with options
* Some of the emojis are duplicates, use the regex to catch them and remove the duplicate data uri from the .less file

## Javascript
* Add configuration options, like maybe allow user to specify a tag and an attribute and emojify would only work on that tag.
* Make this a jQuery plugin, somehow I have a feeling this is pretty easy
* Add jQuery QUnit tests, again, should be pretty testable.
